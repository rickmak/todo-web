# todo-web
A Simple todo app run in browser. This project do not have any external dependencies.

## Bugs:

- A deleted to-do item re-appear on reload
- Enter at the input box cannot add item

## Tasks:

1. Show me you can read code and produce good clean code
2. Fix the above bugs
3. list.js and item.js are in different style, try to compare and unify
   (okay to just think of direction within time, we can discuss it later)
4. Any refractoring you think will make the code better,
   reduce the chance to produce above bugs

## Constraint

- You are not allowed to import extenal library
- Time limits is 1 hr
- Commit should be atomic

## Evaluation

- We look for clean code
- We look for maintainable code
- How you fix the problem is more important than how fast you fix it
